# Cobrust F44-F70 batch — README

Twenty-six new failure-mode findings (F44-F70, with F45a as a systemic-scope
sub-form; F52 and F57 deliberately skipped in Cobrust's local numbering), two
distilled cross-cutting **pattern** docs, and one **methodology-deltas** doc —
all empirically forced by the Cobrust v0.6.0 → v0.7.0 multi-agent run
(2026-05-22 → 2026-05-29). This is a follow-up to the f41-f43 batch (catalogue
through F43) and the f31-f39 batch (F31-F40).

Each finding carries its Cobrust commit SHA(s) as a ground-truth anchor in the
frontmatter (`cobrust_sha`). The slot numbers here ARE the Cobrust local IDs
(unlike f31-f39, which re-mapped local IDs onto free upstream slots) — Cobrust's
own catalogue had already advanced past F43 by the time of this back-port, so the
numbering is shared 1:1.

## What's new in this batch (vs. f41-f43)

Three shapes, all first-class deliverables:

1. **26 findings (F44-F70)** — same Symptoms / Root-cause / Recovery / Evidence
   format as the catalogue, clustered into recurring families (below).
2. **2 pattern docs** — distilled, multi-finding playbooks that sit above the
   individual findings:
   - `cross-compile-target-enablement-pattern.md` (the F4-Cross-Target family
     playbook: where the seams + gotchas live in staged cross-compile enablement)
   - `ecosystem-import-chain-pattern.md` (the 5-layer ecosystem-import / FFI
     marshalling chain + ID-block allocation discipline)
3. **1 methodology-deltas doc** — `methodology-deltas.md` — 8 refinements to
   **ADSD's own** topology / dispatch / audit discipline (NOT failure modes; these
   say "change how we *run* the process", not "the system did X wrong").

## Finding families (clustering)

The 26 findings group into five recurring families plus a methodology track:

| Family | Findings | One-line shape |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **F37-SilentRot** (declared-coverage ≠ actual-coverage) | F44, F45, F45a, F50, F51, F53 | a gate/badge declares coverage the run didn't actually achieve |
| **F35-ClaimDrift** (claim ≠ artifact/diff) | F45, F45a, F46, F48, F50, F53 | the stated scope/version/parity outruns the real artifact |
| **F1-Sediment** (declared-rule ≠ enforced pre-flight) | F46, F49, F54, F55, F65, F69 | a discipline exists as prose; the pre-flight that would enforce it is absent |
| **F-Codegen / parallel-impl drift** | F47, F50, F56, F60 | type-conditional or twin-backend code silently emits wrong output |
| **F4-Cross-Target / non-deterministic-CI** | F58, F59, F61, F62, F63, F66, F70 | a host-target / external-service / cold-build assumption breaks the gate |
| **Methodology deltas** (process refinements) | Deltas 1-8 | how ADSD dispatches + audits, not what a system did wrong |

(Findings appear in more than one family where the root cause is compound — the
frontmatter `family:` field is authoritative per file.)

## Finding summaries

### CI-as-authoritative-oracle hardening (F44, F51, F59, F62 + Delta 6)

- **F44 — CI cache stale-green / false-pass.** A cache hit keys on coarse inputs
  (SHA + lockfile hash) and skips clippy/rebuild recomputation, so a green badge
  stops meaning "workspace clean". Lints lurked across the `a3a636c→e38dfe4`
  window. Resolution: clean-target sweep at every phase-close + cargo-udeps gate +
  consistent `--all-targets --no-deps`. **Parent of methodology Deltas 6 and 7.**
- **F51 — Conditional-compilation scope unlinted.** CI lints only the default
  feature set; code behind opt-in flags accrues rot invisibly. Add a blocking lint
  job under the opt-in feature(s).
- **F59 — External-service dependency gates CI.** A live-HTTP test makes a third
  party's health, not the code, decide green/red. `#[ignore]` + opt-in.
- **F62 — Build-config change surfaces cold-build-only fragilities.** A
  rename/config change is a cold-build event; warm-build audits can't vet it.
  Clean-build cross-platform CI is the only authoritative oracle.

### Stub / parity false-pass family (F45, F45a, F47, F50, F53, F56)

- **F45 — Backend stub silently shipped.** A "Wave-N stub" fallthrough compiles +
  links but no-ops at runtime; "feature-complete" cascades over it. Resolution:
  stdout-diff differential gate + "a stub must cross-reference tracked debt".
- **F45a — Stub-catalogue systemic scope.** When one stub surface is found, the
  same fallthrough usually spans the whole subsystem; enumerate every reachable
  callee and lead docs with the exact user-path scope. (Amended by F53 after an
  over-claim correction.)
- **F47 — Type-conditional codegen emits empty/wrong output.** A default-typed
  temporary (`None`/`0`) routes a value down the wrong formatting arm — silent
  wrong output, no crash. Propagate the callee's declared return type to the
  synthetic return local.
- **F50 — Parallel-surface divergence from duplicated tables.** Two surfaces that
  must agree (LSP + CLI diagnostics) are built from independent copies of one
  table; one ships correct, the other diverges under a parity claim. Single
  source-of-truth + parity smoke + full-corpus sweep.
- **F53 — Default-flip curated-sweep blind spot.** A "stability" sweep declared a
  backend production-ready by running a curated corpus that excluded the
  integration paths the default flip would traverse (30+ silent regressions
  averted). Never flip a default without GREEN on every reachable path.
- **F56 — Correctness fix in only one of two parallel backends.** The unfixed twin
  produces silent garbage until it becomes default. Port correctness fixes to every
  parallel implementation in the same commit.

### Packaging / release discipline (F46, F48, F64, F65)

- **F46 — Package not installable on a fresh environment.** Build-host paths +
  unbundled runtime assets bake into the artifact: works on the build machine, 100%
  broken on a clean one. `current_exe()`-rooted asset lookup + bundle runtime/stdlib
  + post-package extract-and-run smoke gate.
- **F48 — Version-bump must be accompanied by a tag.** Bumping the version string
  without tagging creates a binary whose announced version has no matching artifact.
- **F64 — Lockfile staging is part of the atomic commit.** A dependency edit
  regenerates the lockfile; staging only the manifest makes locked-CI reject the
  drift and fan-out-fail every build job. **Parent of methodology Delta 4.**
- **F65 — Committed example without a paired smoke test is unverified.** A flagship
  demo committed with no end-to-end smoke test didn't even compile, hiding a stack
  of layered gaps because nothing ran it.

### Identity / opsec (F49)

- **F49 — Fresh-workspace identity fallback leak.** A new clone with no local git
  identity falls back to OS account + device hostname, leaking a real name into
  permanent public commit metadata. Neutral global identity (defense-in-depth) +
  per-dispatch identity pre-flight + audit scope follows the actual mutation
  surface. (Sibling of f41-f43's F42.) **Forces methodology Delta 1's audit
  carve-out reasoning.**

### Cross-target enablement + non-deterministic-input (F54, F55, F58, F60, F61, F63, F66, F67, F70)

- **F54** — a transform pass emits a derived sub-payload a companion prepass never
  registered → table-lookup panic on the synthesized form.
- **F55** — a feature-gated integration test links a bare artifact depending on a
  runtime shim in another crate; latent until the feature becomes default.
- **F58** — a "magic" config string (`"native"`) passed verbatim to an API that
  never interprets it: benign on one platform, hard-aborts on another.
- **F60** — deleting one implementation breaks tooling hardcoded to its path AND
  reveals the survivor never carried a declaration the deleted one had.
- **F61** — a negative/error-path test used a real-but-environment-dependent input;
  the "guaranteed-to-fail" case actually succeeds on some platforms.
- **F63** — tests create temp dirs without RAII cleanup; artifacts accumulate
  unbounded in a host-specific temp root the cleanup SOP never named.
- **F66** — cross-target enablement seams live at the toolchain-API boundary, not
  where the source-level config suggests. (Reconstructed from commit `57ebc7e`.)
- **F67** — when every plausible fix candidate verifies clean, suspect the test
  fixture, not the system under test. (Reconstructed from commit `d29470f`.)
- **F70** — a library's DEFAULT feature set is an implicit host-target assumption
  that breaks on the first constrained cross-target. (**candidate**.)

### Scope / increment-boundary + design-principle debt (F68, F69)

- **F68 — Ship the load-bearing chain, defer the surface sugar.** Land the
  end-to-end functional chain first; defer ergonomic surface sugar — and predict
  the deferred work's blast radius. (Pairs with `ecosystem-import-chain-pattern.md`.)
- **F69 — Constitutional-principle debt erodes at every new call site.** A "we'll
  honor it later" design north star (here CLAUDE.md §2.5 LLM-first: explicit-borrow
  shortcut + error-UX-prints-the-fix) silently erodes at every new call site that
  doesn't honor it. **Status: open** — a forward-looking catalogue entry not yet
  filed in the Cobrust repo. (Sibling of f41-f43's F41 source-surface leakage.)

## Pattern docs

- **`cross-compile-target-enablement-pattern.md`** — the F4-Cross-Target playbook.
  Cross-compile enablement is a *staged pipeline of seams* (build.rs `--target`
  plumbing → codegen target init → cross-cc/sysroot → CI cross-smoke → qemu/wasmtime
  LIVE); failures cluster at the boundary between your toolchain and the vendored
  one and surface only under a live cross-run. Distilled from F66, F67, F70, F58,
  F60, F61. Evidence: `57ebc7e`, `d29470f`, `446016c`.
- **`ecosystem-import-chain-pattern.md`** — the 5-layer ecosystem-import / FFI
  marshalling chain + ID-block allocation discipline (chain-generality sub-form of
  F2-Scope). Distilled from F68 + F41. Evidence: `aeb3f5a`, `caa0510`, `971d4ce`,
  `8c11e16`.

## Methodology deltas (`methodology-deltas.md`)

Eight refinements to ADSD's own dispatch/audit discipline — research-product
co-evolution, not failure modes:

1. **All-top-tier sub-agents** — author *and* audit use the top model; the tier
   matrix is retired (forced by a mid-tier correlated-regression cluster).
2. **Dispatcher-as-context-custodian** — offload raw work by an explicit threshold
   table; the lead keeps only the compression-fragile strategic tier.
3. **Mandatory independent post-author audit** — pre-merge, read-only, different
   agent; Tier-1 (this commit) + Tier-2 (periodic project-wide sweep).
4. **Dependency-manifest staging is part of the atomic commit** — the F64
   generalization, demanded explicitly in the dispatch prompt.
5. **Chain-generality claims verified against the diff** — the F35-sibling guard
   promoted from reactive finding to a routine integration step.
6. **Deterministic-CI / CI-infra-hardening playbook** — concrete hardening for the
   single authoritative gate (disk reclaim, concurrency cancel, FS-visibility
   retry, SHA-pinned actions/toolchains, ignore external/disk-heavy tests).
7. **Honest-signal discipline** — fix true-positive signals by *removal*, never
   mask (the F44 stale-green failure mode in reverse).
8. **Deterministic-orchestration experiment (meta)** — this very back-port ran via
   a deterministic orchestration script; recorded as an ADSD data point + open
   question, not a ratified practice.

## Frontmatter-schema note (honest divergence)

Two frontmatter conventions coexist in this batch, by author cohort:

- **F44-F65** use `catalogue_id:` + `family:` + `cobrust_local_id:` + `cobrust_sha:`.
- **F66-F70** use `doc_kind: finding` + `finding_id:` + `family:` + `cobrust_sha:`.
- **Pattern docs** use `doc_kind: pattern` + `pattern_id:` + `evidence_shas:`.
- **methodology-deltas.md** uses `doc_kind: methodology-deltas` + `batch_id:`.

All four schemas carry a stable ID, a family/era tag, and SHA evidence, so
cross-referencing is unambiguous. A future normalization pass could unify the
`catalogue_id` / `finding_id` keys; it is recorded here rather than papered over.

## Relationship to prior batches

- **cobrust-f31-f39** (F31-F40) and **cobrust-f41-f43** (F41-F43) are independent
  predecessors. This batch can merge before or after either.
- Several entries explicitly cite earlier-batch siblings: F49↔F42 (opsec/identity),
  F69↔F41 (source-surface / principle erosion), and the methodology deltas build
  directly on F43 (CI-as-oracle → Delta 6), F44 (stale-green → Deltas 6 + 7), and
  F64 (lockfile staging → Delta 4).
- This is a **separate methodology repo**; the human reviewer pushes. No push is
  performed by this integration.
